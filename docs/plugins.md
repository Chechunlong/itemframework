# Plugin System

First we need to differentiate between two terms:

* Plugin Container: A shared library (dll,so,dylib) which will be loaded at runtime and can be enabled/disabled by the user.
* Plugin Component: A exported Class which implements a certain interface. Plugin components are bundled in a Plugin Container.





------

* show example of how to instantiate a certain class, or a list of classes implementing a certain interface
* explain singleton and component concept and give an example
